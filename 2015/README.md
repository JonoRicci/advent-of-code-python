## Usage

To get started, follow these commands to set up the Python environment. This will run jobs from the `Makefile` to automatically install python versions, set up dependencies and locally install my `jono_aoc_helpers` python package.

```shell
$ pwd
/advent-of-code-python
$ cd 2015 && pwd
/advent-of-code-python/2015
# Run helper for python version, venv, dependencies
$ make setup
âœ… Development environment ready to go!
```

### Running a solution

All solutions are designed to be ran from the root year folder.

```shell
$ pwd
/advent-of-code-python/2015
$ python day_00_template/day_00.py
```

### Logging

You can select the log level by passing in an argument with `-l` or `--log-level`

```shell
$ pwd
/advent-of-code-python/2015
$ python day_00_template/day_00.py -l DEBUG
$ python day_00_template/day_00.py --log-level DEBUG
```

The accepted inputs are:

```none
DEBUG
INFO
WARN
ERROR
```

### Clean up

If for any reason you need to remove the virtual environment and start again, you can run the following:

```shell
$ pwd
/advent-of-code-python/2015
$ make clean
```

### Make new solution skeleton

When starting a new problem, you can run the following command to set up the subdirectory and create a skeleton solution file:

```shell
$ pwd
/advent-of-code-python/2015
$ make newday DAY=3
```

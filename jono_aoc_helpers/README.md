# Jono's AoC Helper Module <!-- omit in toc -->

This helper module currently exists as a local module imported intended to be imported by pip. It's not versioned yet, which could be a problem if I update the module when previous years are depending on it.

## To Do

1. Version the module (so each year can call a specific version)
   1. Need to publish the module somewhere, currently it's found by relative file path
   2. Do I want it to be publicly available?
2. Keep adding any possible boilerplate
